# Match You?

[中文 README](README.md)

Have you often got troubled like this:

You've took over a new project. However, the dependencies files made a mess -- they're too old to install, or the version used in codes are different from the avaliable libraries -- or there's no files at all!

You've had a hard time with the environment for a long time, but you still found so many problems that made the project away from working.

So you asked the ex-owner, but he/she just showed you that "it worked well"!

--So how do you do now?


> A) Keep making with environment by yourself.
> 
> B) Use "Match You" by RimoChan to solve your problem!


## How to use

Just sent "Match You" to your workmates and when it runs, the dependencies on his/her computer will be deleted! So he/she must do it!

What you do next is staring his/her computer to get the whole process about dependencies!

<sub>(or your workmates cannot deal it either, of course)</sub>


## Let's code it!

I use Python at work so I write for it first. Let's PR and Delete all the dependencies!

目录:

- Python - pip
    - mother.py
    - mother.sh
    - father.py
- Python - conda
    - conda.py
- C# - NuGet
    - nuget.cs
- java - Gradle
    - mother.java
- Swift
    - mother.swift
- Swift - CocoaPods
    - cocoapods.swift
- Golang
    - mother.go
- kotlin - Gradle
    - mother.kt
- Node.js - npm
    - mother.js
    - grandmother.js

And don't forget one thing, the goal is to clean up the existing dependencies, not making the environment worse, so do not delete anything like configuration files...
